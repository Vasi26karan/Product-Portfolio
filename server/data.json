    "intro":"The first step in IoT device management is device provisioning; getting your devices and sensors configured safely and efficiently in your network to upload their data securely. IoT device provisioning is one of the first steps you must take when developing your IoT network. Think of it as setting up a mobile phone when you first buy one; you take it out of the box and turn it on. You select the language, connect to the Wi-Fi network, activate the device on the mobile data network and an array of other steps. IoT devices work in a similar way on your enterprise network to ensure they work safely and as intended. The term provisioning for a device means to evolve a device to a state in which it can be handed off to an end-user for their specific use in a functional manner. Provisioning means providing or making something available, so your mobile phone becomes user friendly or the IoT device is connected to the network so it can start tracking the equipment characteristics." ,
